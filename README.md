# Python Interpreter for CS4450 written in C#

## Our Project

Our project was to design a simple Python interpreter. 
We decided to use C# to write it because that is the language we have the most experience with and enjoy using the most.
We used a couple of NuGet libraries to help with our interpreter, most notably [mXparser](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MathParser.org-mXparser/4.4.2).

## Requirements

We had to implement various things for this interpreter:

- `if`/`else` blocks
- Variable Definitions
- `while` and `for` loops
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`) (done)
- Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `^=`, `%=`)
- Conditional statements (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) (done)
- Comments, which are everything after `#` (done)
- The function `print` (done)

## How to use

The simplest way to use this interpreter is to open the project up in Visual Studio and run the code using the built in debugger/compiler.
